<pre tabindex="0"><code>Capitalism, a system that once promised wealth,
Has now brought forth a life unfelt.
Greed and exploitation, its toxic roots entwine,
Leaving behind a world that's lost its shine.
The rich get richer while the poor are left to fall,
Their hopes and dreams are crushed under capitalism's thrall.
The earth is plundered for the sake of endless growth,
Leaving behind a legacy of environmental woe.
Oh, the perils of capitalism, a warning to us all,
Break free from its grasp before it's too late to call.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>In the woods at night, a sight to behold
A green owl perched on a branch so old
Its feathers shimmered in the moonlight bright
A captivating vision in the silent night

With eyes so big and wide, it looked around
As if it owned the forest, as if it wore a crown
The leaves rustled softly in the gentle breeze
But the green owl remained as still as the trees

It seemed almost magical, this creature so rare
A green owl in the wild, so stunning and fair
What secrets did it keep, what tales to tell?
In the depths of the forest, did it live well?

Perhaps it ruled the night with its emerald sheen
A regal bird, a wonder to be seen
And as I watched it, lost in thought
The green owl flew off, as if it was sought

But its image stayed with me, engraved in my mind
A green owl, so majestic and kind
May it continue to soar through the night
A symbol of beauty, a wondrous sight.

<p>Agree? Cats are better than dogs for some people as they require less attention &amp; exercise, are more independent, and easier to care for. They also don&rsquo;t need to be walked, are more hygienic, and take up less space.</p>

Lurking in the shadows where none of us sleep.
An inescapable fate that comes for us all,
A silent reminder that we are but mere mortals.
It whispers in our ears, a haunting refrain,
Reminding us of life's fleeting nature and pain.
With bony fingers, it beckons us near,
Its grip tightens with each passing year.
But though its shadow may loom large and grim,
We need not fear, for we are more than flesh and limb.
Our memories, our love, will live on in the hearts of those we knew,
And Death's embrace, though final, is just a passage to a new.

With profits as their only guiding shroud.
Capitalist greed drives their every move,
With no regard for those they choose to remove.

They dominate the market with their might,
Their power grows with each passing night.
They gobble up the competition with ease,
Leaving workers struggling just to survive in peace.

The people at the top, they live in luxury,
While those below, they work in poverty.
The divide between the rich and poor grows wide,
As the edgeless corporation takes and takes with pride.

They sell their products with a dazzling grin,
Concealing the true cost of their deadly sin.
The environment, the workers all but ignored,
As the almighty dollar becomes their Lord.

But one day, the people will rise and say,
&quot;No more will we be pawns in your capitalist play.&quot;
They'll stand together, hand in hand,
And demand a better world, a brighter land.

So let us all work to break these chains,
And build a future free from greed and pains.
An edgeless corporation may bring wealth,
But it's up to us to ensure their power is felt.

		<a href="https://llbbl.blog/2023/01/29/wealth-inequities-under.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-29 12:31:59 -0600">Jan 29, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">

<p>As an economic system, capitalism has been a driving force in the development and growth of many countries. However, it has its challenges, particularly when it comes to the distribution of wealth. One of the most significant issues with capitalism is that it can lead to substantial wealth inequality. This is due to the fundamental flaws of human nature and the consequences of inaction.</p>
<p>Humans, by nature, are flawed. We are driven by self-interest, greed, and the desire for power and control. These characteristics can lead to wealth accumulation in the hands of a select few while the majority struggles to make ends meet. In a capitalist system, where wealth accumulation is the ultimate goal, these flaws are amplified and result in an unequal distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, inaction and support of the status quo can lead to an even more inequitable system. When individuals and societies accept the current state of affairs and do not actively work to address the issues of wealth inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. As a result, the rich continue accumulating wealth and power, while the poor are left with fewer opportunities and resources.</p>
<p>It is essential to note that progress and economic growth are necessary for a thriving society. However, we should not have to sacrifice our morality and ethics to pursue improvement. Wealth inequality is a significant moral issue, and our responsibility is to address it. We must actively work to create a more equitable system where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and where wealth is distributed fairly.</p>
<h2 id="can-imperfect-beings-create-tools-to-solve-inequities-in-their-society">Can Imperfect Beings Create Tools to Solve Inequities in Their Society?</h2>
<p>It is true that humans, as imperfect beings, have created systems and structures that perpetuate inequality and injustice. However, it is also true that we can recognize and address these issues and develop tools to solve them. One example is the development of social welfare programs and progressive taxation systems, which aim to redistribute wealth and provide resources and opportunities for marginalized and disadvantaged people.</p>
<p>Another example is the growing movement for economic democracy, which aims to give workers and communities more control over the financial decisions that affect their lives. This can take the form of worker cooperatives, community land trusts, and other forms of democratic ownership and control of resources.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these tools and systems could be better, and they are constantly evolving. Therefore, they require ongoing work, monitoring, and improvement. But it is precisely because we are imperfect beings that we must continually strive to create and improve the tools we use to address inequality and injustice in our society.</p>
<h2 id="hope-over-despair">Hope over Despair</h2>
<p>It is easy to feel despair when faced with the enormity of the problems of wealth inequality and injustice in our society. But it is important to remember that change is possible and that we have the power to create a more equitable and just society.</p>
<p>One way to maintain hope is to focus on the progress that has been made and to acknowledge the contributions of those who have fought for and achieved change. We can also look at successful campaigns and movements and learn from the strategies and tactics used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on what you can change</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to maintain hope is to focus on the actions that we can take, both as individuals and as a collective. For example, we can support organizations and movements working toward economic justice and advocate for policies and systems that promote equity and fairness.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s essential to remember that hope is not only a feeling but also an action. We can find hope in the small steps we take every day and in the knowledge that we are working towards a better future for ourselves and future generations.</p>

			 <p>As the pandemic hit and many of us were confined to our homes, I found myself getting back into blogging. I had always enjoyed writing, but over the years, I had fallen out of the habit. But with so much extra time, I decided to start posting on Medium again.</p>
<p>Around six months ago, I stumbled upon a new platform called Micro.blog. I was immediately intrigued by its unique features and the community formed around it. However, I didn‚Äôt have time to dive in and explore it further with everything else going on.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and I am excited to dive into the Micro.blog finally. One of the things that I love most about it is its <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95">support for ActivityPub</a>, an open standard for decentralized social networking.</p>
<p>Another great feature of Micro.blog is its simplicity. The platform is designed to be easy to use, with a clean and straightforward interface. This makes it perfect for bloggers who are just starting out or for those who are looking for a more streamlined blogging experience. Additionally, Micro.blog offers a variety of customization options, such as the ability to choose from various templates and add your custom CSS. This allows users to make their blogs stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting features is the ability to host your microblog on your domain, this would give you more control over your data, and it&rsquo;s a great way to build your brand.</p>
<p>With Micro.Blog, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about maintenance, security issues, or paying for Plugins. Everything you need to start writing and creating is included. The platform takes care of all the technical aspects of running a blog, such as hosting, backups, and updates, so you can focus on creating content. This contrasts WordPress, where you must handle all of these technical aspects or pay for a managed hosting service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be using the Micro.blog and explore all it offers. The platform&rsquo;s support for ActivityPub and Mastodon and its dedicated community make it an excellent option for bloggers looking for a new home. I&rsquo;m eager to see what the future holds for Micro.blog and how it will continue to evolve.</p>
